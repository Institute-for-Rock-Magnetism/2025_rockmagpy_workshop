    "## Background on MagIC\n",
    "\n",
    "The Magnetics Information Consortium (MagIC), hosted at http://earthref.org/MagIC is a database that serves as a Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) archive for paleomagnetic and rock magnetic data. Its data model is fully described here: [https://www2.earthref.org/MagIC/data-models/3.0](https://www2.earthref.org/MagIC/data-models/3.0). Each contribution is associated with a publication via the DOI.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are nine data tables. The fields associated with these tables are detailed here: https://www2.earthref.org/MagIC/data-models/3.0\n",
    "\n",
    "- contribution: metadata of the associated publication.\n",
    "- locations: metadata for locations, which are groups of sites (e.g., stratigraphic section, region, etc.)\n",
    "- sites: metadata and derived data at the site level (units with a common expectation)\n",
    "- samples: metadata and derived data at the sample level.\n",
    "- specimens: metadata and derived data at the specimen level.\n",
    "- measurements: metadata and measurements at the specimen level.\n",
    "- criteria: criteria by which data are deemed acceptable\n",

    "## Importing data from MagIC\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates the two approaches that can be taken to import data from MagIC into a Jupyter notebook:\n",
    "- **From a locally hosted (i.e. downloaded) MagIC contribution**\n",
    "- **Directly from the MagIC database (using the API)**\n",
    "  - either from a public contribution or\n",
    "  - from a private contribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The MagIC file is then unpacked into its constituent files and loaded as a contribution object. The notebook then summarizes the specimens and the experiments that have been run on them within the data. Finally, it is illustrated how data from a single specimen and single experiment on that specimen can be isolated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the other rockmagpy notebooks, these import methods are used to bring in contribution data. The filtering methods to access data from specific specimens and experiments are used either in the notebooks or within the `rockmag.py` functions."
